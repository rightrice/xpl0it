**Antivirus**
This is a huge work in progress. I have been wanting to challenge myself lately and so I decided to make my own antivirus. So far, it is only in CLI form, and so far it doesn't fully work...hence work in progress.

**Hash Generator/Search**
This project came about because I think the idea of dictionary attacks can be really useful and powerful. However, given password policies and the fact that companies require stronger passwords, your old dictionaries don't work as well as they used to. The idea behind this project is to not only have an already expansive dictionary, but when you request a hash, if it isn't already stored, it will attempt to brute force the hash. Once the hash is brute forced it will add the hash and plain text (hash:plainText) to the dictionary in the event the hash maybe be desired later. This creates a constantly growing and adapting dictionary. In the future, I would also like to add something that will learn based on previous plain texts and have the system attempt to create other possible plain texts/hash combinations on it's own. First I have to develop a system where it will automatically brute force. Again, this is a side project within the original side project.
